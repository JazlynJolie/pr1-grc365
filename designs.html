            <h2>Named Collective Contest</h2>
            <p> Inspired by <b>Named Collective's</b> clothing drop, <i>Enemy Rhinestone</i>. </p>
            <p> While making this press-on nail set I was truly fighting the clock. It took me nearly 2 days trying decide on a design, and I had began making the press-on set design less than 24 hours left of the competition. I was extremely worried I wouldn't be able to post my submission before the deadline, but 30 minutes before 12 am I was able to complete the set and take photos to post as well. </p>

            <h2>Stained Glass</h2>
            <p>A <b>commission</b> by a client for her <i>wedding day</i></p>
            <p> Prior to making this set, I had another stain glass nail set commission that I feel I failed. Once, I got this commission I knew I had to redeem myself, and to this day it's still one of my favorite sets I've made. The symmetry, clean line art and chrome application are so beautiful to look at. </p>
